{"name":"Assignment 4","tagline":"WMS with Leaflet (commented code)","body":"### Requirements\r\nOrganize your files, folders, and code so that it will be easy for you and others to navigate and interpret. Separate the different assignments into their own folders, and name the folders consistentlyâ€”keep the capitalization, spacing, and naming scheme consistent (e.g., lab1, lab2, lab3). Delete useless or duplicate files. In your demo folders, make sure that only the website files are present (e.g., index.html and the css and js folders). Move all other files out of the demo folder. Test your assignment websites afterwards to make sure they still work and that no critical files were removed. Make a backup copy of all files and store them on a different device in a different physical location. \r\nNext, organize the code inside of your website files. Delete unused or duplicate lines of code. Properly indent lines or blocks of code that are nested within other code to illustrate the nesting. For example:\r\n\r\n        <html>\r\n          <head>\r\n            <title>My Title</title>\r\n          </head>\r\n          <body>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <h1>My Heading</h1>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </body>\r\n        </html>\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n        var myobject = {\r\n          \"My Option 1\": op1,\r\n          \"My Option 2\": op2,\r\n          \"My Option 3\": op3\r\n        };\r\n \r\nFinally, add comments in the JavaScript to explain what each major piece of code is doing. For example:\r\n\r\n        // Create a map object and specify the center lat/lon and zoom level\r\n        var map = L.map( 'map' ).setView( [30,-90], 4 );\r\n\r\n### Deliverables\r\nUse Moodle to submit a link to your GitHub demo for this assignment.\r\n### Deadline\r\nTuesday, March 1, at 3pm.\r\n###Tips\r\n* Start this assignment by creating a copy of your lab3 folder. Name it lab4.\r\n* For a step-by-step tutorial on putting the folder on GitHub, see http://moodle2.lsu.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=1178920. \r\n* Not every line of code needs a comment; just put an explanation before every major chunk of code.\r\n* Comments don't need to be a paragraph-long explanation. Assume the reader is familiar with JavaScript, but less so with Leaflet (in other words, explain what the code is doing for the map). Explain customizations or anything you think might confuse the reader or your future self.\r\n* Online storage providers like Google Drive and Dropbox can satisfy the requirement to \"make a backup copy of all files and store them on a different device in a different physical location.\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
